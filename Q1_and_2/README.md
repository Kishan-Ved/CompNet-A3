# Q1

## a

The solution is in the `q1.py` file. This contains 3 code snippets (2 commented, 1 uncommented) that include various experiments and tests that are documented in the report.

Code snippet 2 saves the packet capure in `h3_to_h1_2.pcap`. This is analyzed using wireshark (pic in report).

Run using `sudo python q1.py`

## B

The solution is in the `q1b.py` file. This contains 1 uncommented code snippet using to ping once and generate the pcap file to analyze in wireshark and 3 commnented code snippets containing codes used to run tests that have been recorded in the report.

The packet capture is saved in `h3_to_h1_stp.pcap`. This is analyzed using wireshark (pic in report).

Run using `sudo python q1b.py`

# Q2

The solution is in the `q2.py` file. 

Run using `sudo python q2.py`. This opens mininet CLI that can be used to run experiments and tests. 

There is a commented code block that contains iperf3 tests. The output of these tests is in the .txt files (file names help in identifying the tests).
